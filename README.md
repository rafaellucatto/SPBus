This app shows some information on the buses from SÃ£o Paulo.<br>
It shows you where they are, where their stops are, infos about their lines, and their arrival time by inputting the line code number for the stop where you are at.<br>
This app has been made with the use of MVVM-Coordinator, GoogleMaps (through Cocoapods), customizable (but simple) tablecells, and connection with arbitrary loads (HTTP) on transport security settings.
